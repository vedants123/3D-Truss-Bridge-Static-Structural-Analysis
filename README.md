This repository contains a 3D structural analysis of a steel truss bridge subjected to a point load in Ansys Mechanical. The project employs finite element analysis (FEA) techniques to evaluate stress distribution, displacement, and structural integrity under given loading conditions.
Features:
3D modeling of a steel truss bridge
Application of point load at a specific location
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for stress and displacement calculations
Visualization of results
Exporting contour images and deformation videos
